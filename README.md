![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/node-red-contrib-chatbot.svg)

> Node-RED is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

## Getting started

First of all install  [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

```
$ sudo npm install -g node-red
```

Then open  the user data directory  `~/.node-red`  and install the package

```
$ cd ~/.node-red
$ npm install node-red-contrib-chatbot
$ node-red
```

Then run

```
node-red
```

The next step is to create a chat bot, I reccomend to use **Telegram** since the setup it's easier ( **Telegram** allows polling to receive messages, so it's not necessary to create a https certificate).
Use **@BotFather** to create a chat bot, [follow instructions here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) then copy you access **token**.

Then open your **Node-RED** and add a `Telegram Receiver`, in the configuration panel, add a new bot and paste the **token**

![Telegram Receiver](./docs/images/example-telegram-receiver.png)

Now add a  `Message`  node and connect to the  `Telegram Receiver`

![Simple Message](./docs/images/example-simple-message.png)

Finally add a `Telegram Sender` node, don't forget to select in the configuration panel the same bot of the `Telegram Receiver`, this should be the final layout

![Example Simple](./docs/images/example-simple.png)

Now you have a useful bot that answers *"Hi there!"* to any received message. We can do a lot better.

## Examples
Here are some examples connecting the ChatBot blocks

### Basic Send Message
![Example Message](./docs/images/example-message.png)
The first node `/hi` listen the incoming messages for the string *"/hi"*, if it finds it pass through the outpin otherwise nothing.

The second node `Hi!` simply outputs a message using the templating `Hi {{username}}!`, the message node just prepares the payload for the message, the node `Telegram Sender` actually sends out the message.

The node `Telegram Receiver` sets up some variables in the chat context flow: *firstName*, *lastName*, *chatId* , *username*, *transport*, *messageId*.
*Note*: username is only available in Telegram if it's specified in the chat settings.

### Collect Email
![Example Collect Email](./docs/images/example-collect-email.png)
This is an example of how to parse the user input. The first **Email** block after the receiver just show a prompt message, note that the sender block tracks the user answer, that means that next message from the user will start from here and will be re-routed to the output to the `Telegram Sender` node.

If a valid email is found then the parsed value will be routed to the first output otherwise the second. The parsed email is available as payload or can be stored in the flow context,  for example in the `email` variable.

The **Show Email** is just a simple message block that uses templating to show variables store in flow context (or global): `Your email is {{email}}`
### Authorized Users
![Authorized Users](./docs/images/example-autorized-users.png)
In the node `Telegram Receiver` it's possible to specify a comma seprated list of authorized users (either the userId or the username), for every inbound message the `authorized` boolean variable will be updated in the chat context.

The node `Authorized?` sends the message through the first output is the user is authorized, otherwise the second output.

### Send Image
![Authorized Users](./docs/images/example-image.png)
This example respons to a command `/cam` in the chat sending an image.
The first node `/cam` triggers an http request (for example to the URL of a web cam), then resulting payload is sent to the `Image` node which prepares the payload for the `Telegram Sender` node.
The **/cam** command also triggers a waiting message *"Uploading a photo..."* while the image is downloaded.

### Log Chats
![Authorized Users](./docs/images/example-log.png)
The Log node takes a message payload (inbound or outbound) and trasforms it in a string suitable to be appended to a log file.

```
196520947 [Guidone72] > Thu Jun 30 2016 18:46:31 GMT+0200 - /help
196520947 [Guidone72] < Thu Jun 30 2016 18:46:31 GMT+0200 - Hi this the outbound message as answer
```

### Parse Sentences
The `Listen Node` is able to detect and parse a set of simple sentence with a very simple keyword detection algorithm.
For example suppose we would like to offer the the chatbot user the option to request our curriculum vitae and deliver that by email

![Example Email](./docs/images/example-email.png)

The first block listen to incoming message and verify that it matches a set of tokens, if it matches the message is routed to the first output, otherwise the second output.
The `Listen Node` is configured in this way

![Example Listen Node](./docs/images/example-listen.png)

basically there are a set of tokens that must be present in the message in order to match. It' sufficient that one set of tokens matches to have the message routed to the first output.
The `Listen Node` also takes into account small changes to the word (using  Levenshtein distance algorithm), for example, in that case

```
"send your cv to an_email@gmail.com" // ok
"send your curriculum to an_email@gmail.com" // ok
"send your curricula to an_email@gmail.com" // ok
"send your curriculum" // no, missing email
"send to an_email@gmail.com" // no, missing cv or curriculum token
```

There are some special tokes like `{{email}}` that matches any token that looks like and email and store it the chat context (in that case the key will be "email").

A little bit of coding is required to prepare the payload for the email node

```
// get the chat context
var chat = msg.chat();
// email payload
msg.to = chat.get('email');
msg.payload = 'Hi, this is my curriculum vitae';
msg.attachments = [
  {
   filename: 'my_cv.pdf',
   path: '/my_cv.pdf'
}];
return msg;
```

The first output of the `Listen Node` is also connected to a confirmation message to be sent back to the user: `Sending resume to {{email}}`. Here the variable `{{email}}` is automatically replaced by the value present in the chat context.

### Tracking answers
Complex chatbots may require to request some information to the user and then go on with the rest of the flow, in this example

![Track Conversation](./docs/images/example-track.png)

The user receive a message `"Please enter your email:"`, note that the `Telegram Sender` node has an output, that means that the next message from the same user will be automatically re-routed to the rest of the flow connected to that output, continuing in this way the conversation. The `Parse Node` scan the message for the email and store it the chat context, the final message just show the captured value `"Your email is {{email}}"`.

After 5 minutes if inactivity from the user, the conversation is considered ended and the next messages will be routed the the root of the flow.
In order to enable the output pin `Telegram Sender` check the *track* option in the configuration panel.

### Send a Location
Here is an example where the chatbot request the user location. The user can share his location with the *"share"* button in **Telegram** and **Facebook** or can insert manually the address, here is the flow

![User Position](./docs/images/example-position.png)

First is presented a message to the user asking to share his position, this is connected to a `Telegram Sender`  with the *tracking* option activated, the answer to this message will not start over the flow but will continue to the nodes attached to this sender output.

The answer of the user is then captured by the `Parse node`, which parse the incoming message searching for a location-type message (an object containing latitude and longitude) and it's the result of the user sharing the position with the chat client ( *Telegram* or *Facebook* ). If it doesn't match the message is routed to the second output, (this happens when the user writes his location manually) to the **Google Geolocation** node.

The final message just the coordinates `"Your position is {{location.latitude}}, {{location.longitude}}"`

### RiveScript parser
[RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) is a simple scripting language for chatbots with an easy to learn syntax.

![RiveScript](./docs/images/example-rivescript.png)

The most simple script
```
! version = 2.0

+ hello bot
- Hello, human!
```
If the user input matches *"Hello bot"* it returns on the first output the string *"Hello, human!"*.
If the `RiveScript node` doesn't match anything, it sends the error message to the second output.
Read the [RiveScript tutorial](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial) for all language details.

`RiveScript node` is able to read user input and store it in the chat context
```
! version = 2.0

+ my name is guido
- <set name=<star>>ok, I'll remember your name as <get name>
```
`RiveScript node` its also able to deal with topics. Topics are a way to restrict parsers context based on the user intention, for example the same the user question *"what to do next?"* could have different answers based on the user topic, for example
```
! version = 2.0

+ what to do next
- Please register, what is your email?

+ *
% please register what is your email
+ <set email=<star>><topic=registered>Thank your <get firstName>

> topic registered
  + what to do next
  - Time to buy a ticket...
< topic
```

### Api.ai
Api.ai has a powerful NLP and it's possible to exploit it through the **API.ai** node.
With **Api.ai** it's easy to parse sentences like *"I want to switch on the lights of the living room"* and extract key variables.

- **Context:** have the same meaning of **topic** in **RedBot** (do not confuse with chat context in **RedBot** ), the purpose is to restrict the working area of the parsers based on a context of the sentence. For example the words *"the email is an_email@gmail.com"* can trigger a particular action it the user is signing up with the chat bot (for example topic or context *"signup"* ) and a different one if the user intention is to send an email to someone with the chat bot (for example topic or context *"send_message"*)
* **Intent:** is a set of rules for parsing user's sentences and detect a set of entities in order to consider the sentence complete. For example in the sentence *"I want to switch on the lights in the living room"*, the entities are *Furniture* (lights), *OnOff* (on) and *Room* (living room).
By setting these entities as mandatory to consider the sentence complete, the **Api.ai** intent is able to parse them and ask further questions if the sentence is missing some informations (for example after *"I want to switch on the lights"* it could ask *"In which room?"*).
When the sentence is complete the Intent changes the context/topic, for example to *"switch_lights"*, in this way it's possible to let  **RedBot** takes action for this context.
 * **Entity:** are sets of objects of the same class. For example in a sentence like *"I want to switch on the lights in the living room"* the entity **Room** can contain: living room, kitchen, lavatory, etc

The `Api.ai node` works like a kind of loop: the first output is always connected to a message node, this allows the `Api.ai node`  to keep asking question to the user until all the intent requirements are met.
When the sentence is complete and **Api.ai** has moved  to a new topic (context in **Api.ai** ) the message is forwarded to the proper output based on the matched topic (just like the `Topic node` ).

## Chat Context
**Node Red** has two variable context *global* and *flow*, the first is available everywhere in the app, the second just in the executed flow.

 **Node-red-contrib-chatbot** adds the *chat* context where is possible to store information related to the specific user. The Receiver store here some default information like *chatId*, *username*, *authorized*, *firstName*, *lastName*, etc.

To get the chat context in a function node:

```
var chat = msg.chat();
console.log(chat.get('authorized')); // is the user authorized
console.log(chat.get('username')); // guidone72
chat.set('my_stuff', 'remember that');
```

### Template Variables
In the template system some defaults variables are available using the *{{variable}}* syntax

* **chatId** - The chat id (same for a specific user)
* **messageId** - The message id
* **userId** - The user id
* **firstName** - First name, when available (for example in Telegram must me specified in preferences)
* **lastName** - Last name, when available (for example in Telegram must me specified in preferences)
* **authorized** - boolean, whether the user is authorized or not
* **transport** - the current transport, could be *telegram*, *facebook*, *slack*
* **message** - the current message from the user in string format

## Advanced
### Prepare messages in upstream nodes
`Text node` supports basic *Handlebars* -like templates, sometimes this is not enough and a proper message needs to be prepared in an upstream node.
Every message node (Text, Image, etc) accepts  strings, images, etc. as input, preparing a message in an upstream node it's very simple, for example:

![Prepare text in upstream node](./docs/images/example-programmatically-text.png)

The `Function node` looks like
```
console.log(msg);
var chat = msg.chat();
msg.payload = 'This is a special message ' + chat.get('firstName');
```
This only works if the message parameter is left blank.

It's important to understand how RedBot keeps track of the current conversation, in the above node the console log will looks like

```
{
  originalMessage: {
    ...
  },
  payload: {
    type: 'text',
    ...
  }
}
```

This is how **Node-RED** works: for every incoming event a message (the *msg* object) is generated and it's sent across the flow based on the wiring.
The **payload** key contains the real content of the message (could be a incoming text message or a buffer for an image, etc) while the **originalMessage** contains the tracking of the conversation.

Inside a **Function node** you're free to modify the payload of a message and everything will still work as long as the originalMessage is kept intact and passed through the next node.

For every message node it's possible to prepare the message in the upstream node, for an image for example

![Prepare text in upstream node](./docs/images/example-programmatically-image.png)

Here the `File node` puts the loaded file into the payload as a Buffer (keeping the rest of the *msg* object intact), the Image node reads it and prepare the proper payload for the sender node.

Generally every message node (like Text, Image, etc) should be wired to a sender.

**So the key concept is that every node in Node-RED should preserve the msg object, change its payload as needed and passed through the next node.**

 Keep in mind that if a Function node make some changes to a *msg* object **and has a sibling** (another node is connected to the same upstream node), the message node must be cloned

```
var cloned = RED.util.cloneMessage(msg);
cloned.payload = 'My payload';
return cloned;
```

The reason is that **Node-RED** is asynchronous and single threaded, the *msg* object sent to the sibling nodes is the very same instance.
It's not possible to tell which node will be executed first, so if the first executed node changes the *msg* object , the second one will receive a different payload causing unwanted side effects very difficult to track down.

### Error Handling
The **Node-RED**  `Catch all node`  will intercept any relevant error raised by the receivers/senders.
This might be useful to take appropriate actions based on the chat user (*chatId*). The error payload will be:

```
{
  chatId: 1234,
  code: 403, // error code, it depends on the platform
  description: 'Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user',
  error: ... // original error object
}
```
